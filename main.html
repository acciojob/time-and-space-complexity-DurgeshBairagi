	<h1>Time Complexity and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a measure of the computational efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the time it takes to complete as a function of the input size. It provides a way to analyze the performance and efficiency of algorithms, helping to determine which algorithm is more efficient for large inputs. Common time complexity classes include O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), and O(nÂ²), each representing different levels of efficiency. </p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b>is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm needs to run as a function of the input size. It provides insight into how much additional space is required by the algorithm beyond the input data.</p>
